This folder contains our solution to the [OpenProblems-NeurIPS2021 Single-Cell Multimodal Data Integration](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1111/overview). Our team AXX took the [4th place of the modality prediction task](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1111/leaderboard/2860) in terms of overall ranking of 4 subtasks: namely `GEX to ADT`, `ADT to GEX`, `GEX to ATAC` and `ATAC to GEX`. Specifically, our methods ranked **3rd** in `GEX to ATAC` and **4th** in `GEX to ADT`. More details about the task can be found in the [competition webpage](https://openproblems.bio/neurips_docs/about_tasks/task1_modality_prediction/).
