This folder contains our training pipeline and script used for the **NeurIPS 2021 Competition - Multimodal Single-Cell Data Integration**, the **Predict Modality** task. Our team **scJoint** took [3rd place of the modality prediction task](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1111/leaderboard/2860) in terms of the overall ranking of 4 subtasks: namely `GEX to ADT`, `ADT to GEX`, `GEX to ATAC`, and `ATAC to GEX`. Specifically, our methods ranked 3rd in `GEX to ADT` and 4th in `ATAC to GEX`. More details about the training configurations can be found in our project ([link](https://github.com/itscassie/scJoint-neurips2021-modality-prediction)).
